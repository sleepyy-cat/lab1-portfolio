    <p>
        Hi everyone, I'm Hanna! I'm a senior at MIT double majoring in math and computer science. I've played piano and violin 
        (mostly classical music) for more than a decade. I also really enjoy listening to music--classical, pop artists like 
        Taylor Swift and Gracie Abrams, and just about anything else as well. In my free time, in addition to music, I also like 
        hanging out with my friends and playing games like DnD and Celeste.
